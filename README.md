# AI4PD Workshop 2023

We are pleased to announce the AI4PD Workshop 2023. This workshop focused on the intersection of AI and Protein Design will be held in Puerto Varas, Chile. Below is a highlight of the scientific sessions.

## AWS Installation Instructions

To successfully set up the workshop environment on AWS, follow the steps below:

1. First, clone the AI4PD_2023 repository along with its submodules using the following git command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pb3lab/AI4PD_2023.git
```
This command will download the main repository and all associated submodules.

2. Navigate into the cloned repository:

```bash
cd AI4PD_2023
```

3. Now, install the ColabDesign package. This package contains useful tools for protein design. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install -q git+https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabDesign.git
```

After following these steps, you should have a working environment ready for the AI4PD workshop. If you encounter any problems during the installation, please contact the workshop organizers for assistance.
